# L206
An experiment in interactivity using React to replicate 2048, making use of interactivity and state saving. Some changes to the Graffiticode backend seem to have caused minor startup glitches, but most of the features remain operable.

[`Here`](http://www.graffiticode.com/item?id=158337+473724) is an example of many of the major features, which can be seen on [`the Vocabulary Specification`](https://github.com/artcompiler/L206/wiki/Vocabulary-Specification).
